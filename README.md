# Bayesian item response theory (IRT) implemented with pystan and numpyro
This repository includes source code of our paper (Usefulness of pystan and numpyro in Bayesian item response theory).

In the source code, Bayesian IRT models (1PL-IRT and 2PL-IRT) are implemented with pystan and numpyro.
In our paper, the estimation results of the latent parameters of 1PL-IRT and 2PL-IRT were compared between pystan and numpyro using the source code of this repository. 


# Requirement
